This is a locally stored record of my work on Voltron, so this may fall out of date.
I did my best to explain the I/O in a comment at the top of each script.

Generally these scripts are concerned with correlating ChIP-seq data with loop lists directly, and with various features on a graph of loops in the genome to find families of architecturally relevant proteins.
